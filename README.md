# Quill.js

An all in one discord bot made using the discord.js library. The bot works using slash commands, and as for non slash commands, the prefix is `q.`

## Features

### 1. Toggling command types

The bot allows the server owner to choose which all command types should be enabled in that server

For any user in that server, in order to view which all are the allowed types, simply run the following command in the server:
```
q.allowed_commands
```
The output of this functions should be the following if, as an example, all the commands are turned on, except the chess commands:
```
Enabled commands:
- Admin
- Code
- Math
- Misc
- Random
- Science
- Time

Disable commands:
- Chess
```

For the server owner to choose which all commands must be enabled or disable, the `q.allow_command` command, which is case insensitive.
```js
q.allow_command [TYPE] [BOOLEAN: true, false]
```
For example, to disable the chess command, the following command should be run in the server:
```js
q.allow_command chess false
```
Or for example, to enable the math command, the following command should be run in the server:
```js
q.allow_command math true
```
The command types would be the same as the name of the folder that holds those commands, which are present under the `commands` folder. The changes will all be saved into a json file (`allowed_comamnds.json`), in the source folder, which must be present for the program to run.

### 2. Owner commands

These are commands reserved just for the creator of the bot, for debugging the bot, editting the console, getting some data from the bot, controlling the bot, etc.

The following are the syntax of all of these commands:
```py
q.cls # Clears the console
q.deletemsg [message_id] # Deletes a message
q.echo [user | channel] [object_id] [content] # Sends a message
q.guild_ids # Collects the server IDs of all the servers the bot is in
q. guild_names # Collects the names of the servers the bot is in
q.readfile [path] # Outputs the contents of a path
q.readfolder [path] # Outputs the files and folders
q.status [online | dnd | idle | invisible] # Change the status of the bot
q.stop # Stops the bot
```
These can be gotten using the `q.help` command as well, whose output should contain the names of all the owner commands. Though it can provide a description for all the owner commands like this:
```
q.help [commands_name]
```
The output should something like this if the inputted command was the echo command for example
```
Description:
Send a message to a user or channel

Syntax:
q.echo ( user / channel ) id content
```

## Commands

Commands are divided based on a type, these types are the following:

1. Admin
2. Chess
3. Code
4. Math
5. Misc
6. Random
7. Science
8. Time

A help command is also present to provide all the commands in a specific type
```
/help [type]
```

The following few sections shall look over all the commands within these types

### 1. Admin commands

Admin commands are commands generally usable only by those given some higher permission in a server.

The commands given as admin commands are the following:

1. kick
2. ban
3. unban

#### Kick

This command simply removes a member from the server, it does not permanently remove them.

**Syntax**
```
/kick [user]
```

#### Ban

As the name suggests, this command simply bans a user from the server. Once run, the user will be immediately banned from the server.

**Syntax**
```
/ban [user]
```

#### Unban

This command removes the ban on a user, basically re-allowing them to rejoin the server after having been banned. Note that this command needs you to input the user's id instead, which can be acquired from the server settings.

**Syntax**
```
/unban [user_id]
```

### 2. Chess

These are commands that allow using chess inside of discord itself.

The commands given as chess commands are the following:

1. possible_moves
2. random_game
3. validate_fen

#### Possible moves

This command returns all the possible moves in a given position

**Syntax**
```
/possible_moves [fen]
```

#### Random game

This commands generates a random game, full of just random moves, till the game is over

**Syntax**
```
/random_game
```

#### Validate FEN

This commands checks whether a given fen is possible or not

**Syntax**
```
/validate_fen [fen]
```

### 3. Code

These are commands that are related to programming or files

The commands that come under the code type are the following:

1. code
2. display_file

#### Code

This command allows you to display a snippet of code in a neat embed. Upon running the command, a prompt will come up asking for the file type and the code. The file type is required for the code highlighting. The code will then be displayed in clean embed in discord constisting of the author of the code at the top, and the code itself.

**Syntax**
```
/code
```

#### Display file

This command allows you to display a local file from your device in a neat embed.

**Syntax**
```
/display_file [file: Has to be attached] [description: Unrequired]
```

### 4. Math

```

#### Saved formulas

This is a command that allows you to save formulas, use them, and delete them. This function can do multiple things at once depending on the `method` argument. The formulas are saved in a json file holding your user id, thus the formulas are saved indirectly in your discord account. All the inputted values are case sensitive.

If the `method` argument is `List`, then the program would list out all the formulas you have saved to your account along with the formula they hold. When the method is to list out all the formulas, the `name` and `inputs` arguments can simply be left with anything; the input given to those two arguments wouldn't change the resulting output.

If the `method` argument is `Use`, the the program will evaluate the formula with given inputs. The `name` argument can hold the name of the formula, while the `inputs` argument can hold all the inputs seperated by commas (For example: a = 2, b = c).

If the `method` argument is `Create`, then the program would create a new formula onto your account. The `name` argument would be what is used to run the formula, and the actual formula can be passed under the `inputs` argument.

If the `method` argument is `Delete`, then the program would delete the formula from your account. The `name` argument can hold the name of the formula you want to delete, and the `inputs` argument can be left empty.

**Syntax**
```
/saved_formulas [method: List | Use | Create | Delete] [name] [inputs]
```

### 5. Misc

1. element
2. periodic_table
3. word_to_elements

#### Element

This function allows you to give one information of an element from the periodic table, such as the name, symbol, or atomic number, and it can return the other two values. The `type` argument refers to the value you are inputting.

**Syntax**
```
/element [type: Name | Symbol | Atomic number] [input: Must corrospond to type]
```

#### Periodic table

This command returns the image of the periodic table

**Syntax**
```

## Environment variables

Some environment variables must be present for the program to run, with data that must be set by the owner. This file must be named `.env`, and must by present just outside the `source` folder. The following are the variables inside of the file:

1. Token
2. Client ID
3. Owner ID
4. Console channel ID
